this is for the models and handing the images....

MEDIA_URL = '/media'/
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')

this two import are important..
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

this import is also need to mentioned in URL.py so,
after the 
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL,document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

this can hangle if my modle's throw's this MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT then it will determine the corrected path...
